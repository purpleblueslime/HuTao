# About
**UwU List** is a playful little anime tier list I made — you can search your favorite shows, then drag and drop them into your own rankings. Think colorful columns, **S** to **F**, all wrapped in a **clean**, **snappy UI** built with **next.js** and a bit of love. It’s still early, so features like saving or sharing aren’t live yet, but seeing friends fight over their hot takes is already wild. *Sometimes, just ranking anime is more fun than finishing your plan to watch list.*

# Run yourself 
You'll need a fairly new v of **node** and **git**!

Fork and **pull**.
```sh
-> git add origin https://github.com/purpleblueslime/UwuList.git 
-> git pull origin
```

Install **deps/dev deps** from [**`package.json`**](./package.json)

## `dev`
```sh
-> next dev
```
view at port **3k**.

## `build`
```sh
-> next build
```
